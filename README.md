# phrase-detector
a simple game to detect the words/phrases unique to 'ayo whats up homie skillets'

for now, it uses regex and also is able to detect repeating characters or substitution of 0:o and 1:i.
maybe future versions will use LLMs to detect the overall message and intent, allowing flagging of the message content rather than the literal words and characters.
